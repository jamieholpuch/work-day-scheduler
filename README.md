Manage your calendar each day by typing an event or meeting in the text area provided next to the associated hour. Click the save button to keep track of your task. The time blocks are color coded as well: if the time block is gray, the hour has already passed; if it is red, it is the present hour; if it is green, the hour has yet to occur. Not sure what day it is? Take a look at the top of the scheduler to find out!
